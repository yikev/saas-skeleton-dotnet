# SaaS Skeleton (ASP.NET Core)

A production-style SaaS backend skeleton built with ASP.NET Core and PostgreSQL.

Focus areas:
- JWT authentication with refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (Admin / Member / Viewer)
- Org-scoped multi-tenant data access
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Docker-based local development
- CI-friendly project structure

This project is intentionally built incrementally to mirror real-world backend development.
